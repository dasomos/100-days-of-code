# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 21, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure portion of the Frontend Development Curriculum on freeCodeCamp. 35%

**Thoughts:** It is really boring as at the beggining its just basic syntax and more-or-so vocab of the programming language. Excited to see how I can implement it into my websites.
